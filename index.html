                    <h3>HISTORICAL CONTEXT</h3>
                    <p>José Rizal wrote Noli Me Tangere between 1884 and 1887 while studying in Spain and traveling through France and Germany. Inspired by Uncle Tom’s Cabin, he aimed to expose Spanish oppression in the Philippines and awaken national consciousness. Financial difficulties nearly prevented its publication, but with Maximo Viola’s help, Rizal printed 2,000 copies in Berlin in 1887. Due to budget constraints, he had to shorten the novel. Despite these challenges, Noli Me Tangere became a powerful and controversial work, sparking debates and eventually being banned by Spanish authorities.</p>
